[runtime: wait for active panic before exit on Windows #20018](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20018)



**runtime/proc.go**

```go
// Make racy client program work: if panicking on
	// another goroutine at the same time as main returns,
	// let the other goroutine finish printing the panic trace.
	// Once it does, it will exit. See issues 3934 and 20018.
	if atomic.Load(&runningPanicDefers) != 0 {
		// Running deferred functions should not take long.
		for c := 0; c < 1000; c++ {
			if atomic.Load(&runningPanicDefers) == 0 {
				break
			}
			Gosched()
		}
	}
	if atomic.Load(&panicking) != 0 {
		gopark(nil, nil, waitReasonPanicWait, traceEvGoStop, 1)
	}

	exit(0)
	for {
		var x *int32
		*x = 0
	}
```
